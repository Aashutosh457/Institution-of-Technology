        A training institution is in fact a college that offers a variety of courses like bookkeeping that aim to teach and train the student in a specific field. Courses at a training institute equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to function in a particular job. <br>  <br>

Further Education and Training (FET) colleges offer occupational or vocational courses. These courses are specifically designed to focus on the career that you would like to pursue. FET Colleges offer certificate and diploma courses. If you are more interested in studying towards a degree, it is advised to apply at a university.<br> <br>

If you do not meet the requirements for university, you can start your studies at a college, and continue to university once you have the necessary background education and training that is required at university entrance level. <br> <br>

A distance learning college is a good choice for furthering your studies, as you can work and further your education at the same time.
